# 📈 Bitfinex Order Book Replica 📉

Welcome to the ultra-cool and supercharged 🚀 project where I replicate the Bitfinex Order Book widget! Dive into the world of cryptocurrency with real-time data streaming 🌊, showing the top bids and asks without needing to hit refresh.

This project prioritized understanding the Bitfinex API and structuring the app efficiently 🛠️. While some features like precision control and connect/disconnect functionality were conceptualized, the focus was on ensuring a solid foundation and real-time data accuracy 🎯. More time was invested in grasping the Bitfinex API intricacies and planning a scalable application architecture, laying the groundwork for future enhancements.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data** 🚀: Stay updated with the latest market movements without manual refreshes.
- **Top Orders Focus** 🎯: Display only the top 15 bids and asks, ensuring the most relevant data is front and center.
- **Slick UI** 💅: Thanks to `shadcn`, the interface is not just functional but also easy on the eyes.

## Planned Features

- **Precision Control** 🔍: Conceptualized feature to adjust price precision with simple `+` and `-` buttons, allowing for a customized view of the order book data.
- **Connect/Disconnect** 🔌: Planned functionality to manually manage the WebSocket connection, providing more control over data streaming and optimizing resource usage.
